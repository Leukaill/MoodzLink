# Final Setup Steps for MoodzLink

## ✅ Migration Complete!

The migration from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment is complete. Here's what was accomplished:

### What's Done:
- ✅ App running on standard Replit environment (port 5000)
- ✅ Replaced Cloudinary with Supabase Storage
- ✅ Updated all upload functions to use Supabase
- ✅ Database schema already exists in your Supabase project
- ✅ Authentication enhanced with user syncing
- ✅ DATABASE_URL configured with your password

### Final Step Needed:
You need to manually create 2 storage buckets in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard** → Storage section
2. **Create these buckets:**

   **Bucket 1: media-files**
   - Name: `media-files`
   - Public: ✅ Yes
   - File size limit: 10MB
   - Allowed file types: `image/*`, `video/*`, `audio/*`

   **Bucket 2: profile-pictures**
   - Name: `profile-pictures`
   - Public: ✅ Yes
   - File size limit: 5MB
   - Allowed file types: `image/*`

### That's It!
Once you create those 2 buckets, your app will be fully functional with:
- File uploads working
- User authentication working
- Database operations working
- Real-time features ready

The app is already running and ready to use once the storage buckets are created.
