### ðŸ”§ Final Setup Steps (2 minutes):

Since we had network connectivity issues, please complete these final steps manually:

2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**

3. Create bucket: `profile-pictures` (Public: Yes, Max size: 5MB)

#### 3. Set Storage Policies (30 seconds)
In the SQL Editor, run these commands:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload to media-files
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads to media-files" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'media-files' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public access to media-files
CREATE POLICY "Public access to media-files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media-files');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload to profile-pictures
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads to profile-pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
