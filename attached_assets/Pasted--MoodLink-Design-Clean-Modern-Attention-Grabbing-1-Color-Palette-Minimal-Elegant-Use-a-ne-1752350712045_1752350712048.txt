ðŸŽ¨ MoodLink Design â€“ Clean, Modern & Attention-Grabbing
1. Color Palette: Minimal & Elegant
Use a neutral base: whites, light greys, soft off-whites

Accent colors: one or two bold solid colors (like deep blue or vibrant coral) for buttons, emojis, and highlights

Dark mode: charcoal backgrounds with light text and the same accent colors for consistency

No gradients, just solid colors with strong contrast for clarity

2. Typography: Crisp & Friendly
Fonts like Inter, Roboto, or SF Pro Rounded â€” modern, highly readable, and approachable

Use font weights smartly: bold for headings and emojis, regular/light for body text

Generous line spacing and padding for a clean look and good legibility

3. UI Elements: Spacious & Intuitive
Lots of white space around cards and buttons so everything breathes

Cards with subtle shadows and rounded corners (8px radius max), minimal borders

Clean iconography: simple line icons or solid icons matching the accent color

Buttons with clear outlines or filled with accent color, no over-the-top effects

4. Animations & Micro-interactions: Subtle & Smooth
Soft fade-ins and gentle scale-ups on hover or tap for buttons and cards

Reaction emojis gently bounce or pulse when tappedâ€”nothing flashy, just a smooth nudge

Loading states with skeleton placeholders shaped like cards â€” minimal skeleton animations (e.g., subtle shimmer)

5. Mood Selector: Simple & Focused
Horizontal scroll carousel with clean circular emoji buttons

Selected mood button gets a subtle solid background fill in the accent color, others remain outlined

No flashy rotation or 3D, just smooth horizontal scrolling and crisp highlighting

6. Daily Mood Photo UI
Minimal fullscreen camera with transparent overlays for controls

Clean circular capture button with accent color border and subtle scale animation on press

Simple confirmation screen with clear Accept/Retake buttons

7. Layout & Navigation
Bottom tab bar with minimal icons and labels, accent color highlights active tab

Floating action button (FAB) for posting mood: simple circle with accent color fill and a crisp icon

Responsive design prioritizing mobile, with clean desktop adaptation (two-column feed maybe)

8. Overall Feel
Calm, uncluttered, inviting

Designed to make users focus on content and emotions, not distractions

A safe digital space thatâ€™s easy on the eyes but feels professional and slick
