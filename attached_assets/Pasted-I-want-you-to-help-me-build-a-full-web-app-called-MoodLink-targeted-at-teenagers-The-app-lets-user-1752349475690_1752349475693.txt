I want you to help me build a full web app called MoodLink, targeted at teenagers. The app lets users post their mood (text, image, audio, or short video), anonymously or semi-anonymously, and interact with others through emoji reactions (🔥 😭 💀 🫶) and mood-based matching.

The app must be:

Fully written in TypeScript

Serverless

Use Firebase Firestore as the main database

Use Firebase Auth for authentication

Use Cloudinary for image/audio/video uploads (instead of Firebase Storage)

Deployed on Vercel or Replit hosting

🧩 Features for MVP:
Authentication (Firebase Auth):

Anonymous sign-in by default

Optional Google/email login

Allow users to set a nickname

Post a Mood:

Users can submit:

Short text (max 300 chars)

One media file (image, audio, or short video)

One mood emoji (😶‍🌫️, 💀, 🥲, etc.)

Media file is uploaded to Cloudinary via an unsigned preset

The secure Cloudinary URL is stored in Firestore with the mood post

Mood Feed:

Displays all posts (newest first)

Filters by mood emoji

Each post shows:

The mood emoji

Timestamp ("5 min ago")

Media preview (if any)

Text (if any)

Emoji reaction buttons (users can react once)

Reactions:

Stored in Firestore per post

Real-time update of counts

Prevent duplicate reactions from the same user

Mood Match:

Feature to "find someone who feels like me"

Finds a recent post with the same emoji as your latest mood

Opens a basic 1-on-1 chat (optional for MVP)

Mood of the Day:

User can upload one daily selfie/mood photo (like BeReal)

Limited to 1 post per day (tracked via Firestore + timestamp)

Also uploaded to Cloudinary

🏗️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Firebase Firestore (serverless)

Auth: Firebase Auth

Media Upload: Cloudinary (via unsigned upload preset)

State Management: React Context or Zustand

Hosting: Vercel or Replit web preview

Animations: Framer Motion (if needed)

🔐 Firebase Rules:
Only authenticated users can post or react

Enforce 1 "Mood of the Day" post per user per day

Reactions must be tied to user ID
