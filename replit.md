## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state and React Context for local state
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth micro-interactions and transitions

### Backend Architecture
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for real-time data and authentication
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with anonymous and Google OAuth options
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary for image, audio, and video uploads
- **Server**: Express.js serving the React app with minimal API endpoints (mainly delegated to Supabase)
- **Real-time Features**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Database Design
The application uses a PostgreSQL schema with the following main tables:
- `users`: User profiles and statistics (streaks, post counts)
- `mood_posts`: User mood posts with media and metadata
- `reactions`: Emoji reactions to posts
- `daily_photos`: BeReal-style daily photo feature

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Anonymous sign-in by default for privacy
- Optional Google OAuth for persistent accounts
- User nicknames for personalization while maintaining anonymity
- Supabase handles session management and security

### Mood Posting System
- Text posts (max 300 characters)
- Media uploads (images, audio, video) via Cloudinary
- Mood emoji selection from predefined set
- Anonymous vs. identified posting options
- Real-time feed updates

### Social Features
- Emoji reactions (ðŸ”¥, ðŸ˜­, ðŸ’€, ðŸ«¶)
- Mood-based matching system
- Daily photo challenges (BeReal-style)
- Real-time notifications and updates

### Gamification Elements
- Daily posting streaks
- Achievement badges (streak milestones, popular posts, etc.)
- User statistics and progress tracking

### Media Handling
- Cloudinary integration for optimized media delivery
- Automatic image optimization and responsive sizing
- Video thumbnail generation
- Audio playback controls

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Supabase handles anonymous/OAuth sign-in
2. **Content Creation**: React forms â†’ Cloudinary upload â†’ Supabase database
3. **Feed Display**: React Query fetches from Supabase â†’ Real-time updates via subscriptions
4. **Interactions**: User actions â†’ Supabase mutations â†’ Real-time propagation
5. **Media Delivery**: Cloudinary CDN serves optimized media based on device/context

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Supabase**: Database, authentication, real-time subscriptions
- **Cloudinary**: Media upload, optimization, and delivery
- **Vercel/Replit**: Hosting and deployment

### Key Libraries
- **UI**: Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query
- **Date Handling**: date-fns
- **Development**: Vite, TypeScript, ESLint

### Environment Variables Required
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Cloudinary cloud name
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`: Cloudinary upload preset

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Local development with Vite dev server
- Hot module replacement for fast iteration
- TypeScript checking and ESLint for code quality

### Production
- Static site generation via Vite build
- Express server serves built React app
- Environment-specific configuration
- Optimized bundles with code splitting

### Hosting Options
- **Replit**: Integrated development and hosting
- **Vercel**: Serverless deployment with automatic scaling
- CDN integration via Cloudinary for media assets

The architecture prioritizes real-time user experience, content safety, and scalability while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase suitable for a teenage audience's social interaction patterns.
